# ft_printf
This project duplicates the basic functionality of the printf function. It was an opportunity for me to learn how variadic functions work, and how to process a variety of arguments to print strings, integers, pointers, hexadecimal characters, etc. It re-uses some of the functions I built in a previous project.

The makefile will generate a static library that includes a number of basic functions for string and memory manipulation and creating and modifying linked lists, in addition to the new content of the ft_printf function.
